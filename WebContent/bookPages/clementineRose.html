						<p class = "regular">Will an unexpected emergency ruin Clementine's party plans?<br><br>
						Clementine Rose is counting down the days until her birthday party. But first there's the school sports carnival to attend and a very special race to run. There's also the all-important party theme to decide on!<br><br>
						Amid all the excitement, Lavender doesn't seem her usual self. A trip to the vet is in store, and now Clementine has butterflies in her tummy for all the wrong reasons. 
						Will Lavender be able to attend the party? And why Aunt Violet is acting so mysteriously?
